# Bestow

My dotfiles. Inspired from other users. Feel free to use some part of it!

## Usage

An easy way to deploy the configuration files is to use [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

```bash
# Useful when this repository is cloned in $HOME and
# the package should live in $HOME as well.
# Implicit: you are in the directory of the package,
# and needs to be deployed in the parent directory.
$ stow <package>
```
